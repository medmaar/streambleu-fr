    q: "What resolution and codec does Stream Bleu stream in?",
    a: "Stream Bleu streams in True 4K Ultra HD (3840×2160) using H.265/HEVC encoding — delivering twice the picture quality of H.264 at the same bitrate. HDR10 and Dolby Vision are supported where broadcasters provide HDR feeds, giving you cinema-grade colour and brightness on compatible displays.",
  },
  {
    q: "What internet speed is needed for 4K IPTV?",
    a: "A stable 25 Mbps connection handles 4K H.265 streams without buffering. Français fibre and cable plans at 75 Mbps+ run multiple simultaneous 4K streams with ease. Our servers use Français-optimized routes for low latency — most users see sub-50ms ping.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does Stream Bleu support HDR10 and Dolby Vision?",
    a: "Yes. HDR10 and Dolby Vision are fully supported on compatible streams and players. Pair Stream Bleu with TiviMate or IBO Player on an Apple TV 4K, Samsung QLED, or LG OLED and your display's full HDR capability is automatically engaged — peak brightness, wide colour gamut, the works.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which IPTV player gives the best 4K H.265 performance?",
    a: "TiviMate (Android/Fire TV) is the gold standard for 4K H.265 with hardware acceleration and a clean EPG. IBO Player is included free with 12-month plans and delivers native 4K on Android TV. IPTV Smarters Pro and the Apple TV app are excellent alternatives for iOS and tvOS.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I watch NHL, CFL, and Français sports in 4K?",
    a: "All sports content broadcasts at maximum available quality — 4K where the broadcaster provides 4K feeds. TSN (all feeds), Sportsnet (all regional), CBC Sports, TVA Sports, and RDS are all included. Every NHL, CFL, UFC, NFL, NBA, and MLB game is covered with no blackouts and no extra PPV charges.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does Stream Bleu picture quality compare to cable?",
    a: "Cable TV compresses most content to 1080i or 720p using legacy codecs. Stream Bleu delivers True 4K H.265/HEVC streams — significantly sharper than anything Bell or Rogers offers at standard tiers. Same Français channels, dramatically higher resolution, for up to 90% less per month.",
