Activation was fast, support answered quickly, and live sports finally run smoothly — which never happened before." },
  { name: "Daniel M.", flag: "🇨🇦", rating: 5, title: "Support that actually helps", text: "Customer service is what really made me stay with Stream Bleu. I came from another provider that promised premium servers but disappeared as soon as issues started. With Stream Bleu, support actually listens and responds quickly. Streams are stable even during peak hours." },
  { name: "Oliver T.", flag: "🇺🇸", rating: 5, title: "Consistent from day one", text: "I was skeptical because I've been burned before by IPTV services that work fine for a week and then become unusable. Stream Bleu has been consistent from day one. I tested it during live football and busy evenings, and streams stayed smooth the whole time." },
  { name: "Lucas P.", flag: "🇨🇦", rating: 5, title: "Quality and care far above the rest", text: "After comparing Stream Bleu with two other providers, the difference was obvious. The others were cheaper but unreliable with poor support. Stream Bleu helped me set everything up properly and followed up to make sure it worked." },
  { name: "Michael S.", flag: "🇺🇸", rating: 5, title: "My internet was never the problem", text: "My previous IPTV provider always blamed my internet whenever channels froze. With Stream Bleu, I realized the problem was never my internet. Streams are stable, HD quality is consistent, and live sports finally work without interruptions." },
  { name: "Ethan W.", flag: "🇺🇸", rating: 5, title: "Transparent — delivers exactly what they promise", text: "What impressed me most about Stream Bleu is transparency. Before subscribing, I asked many questions. Support gave honest answers without overselling. After subscribing, everything matched what they promised. No surprises, no outages." },
  { name: "Ryan B.", flag: "🇨🇦", rating: 5, title: "Fast activation and real support", text: "I switched to Stream Bleu after my old service failed during an important match and never replied again. Stream Bleu activated fast, and when I needed help on my Smart TV, support walked me through everything patiently. No serious issues since." },
  { name: "Thomas H.", flag: "🇨🇦", rating: 5, title: "Better stability and far better support", text: "Stream Bleu offers better stability and far better support than other providers I've tried. With others, replies were slow or generic. Stream Bleu support actually reads your message and gives proper help. Channels load quickly and everything works." },
  { name: "Andrew K.", flag: "🇨🇦", rating: 5, title: "Optimized and reliable", text: "I don't usually write reviews, but Stream Bleu deserves one. I came from a provider that overloaded servers and ignored customers. Stream Bleu feels optimized and reliable. Support gave useful tips instead of copy-paste replies." },
  { name: "Nathan C.", flag: "🇺🇸", rating: 5, title: "Consistency other providers can't match", text: "The biggest difference between Stream Bleu and other IPTV services is consistency. My previous providers were unpredictable. Stream Bleu has been stable since day one. Customer service even checked in after activation to make sure everything worked." },
  { name: "William J.", flag: "🇨🇦", rating: 5, title: "The comparison wasn't even close", text: "I tested Stream Bleu alongside my old provider for a week, and the comparison wasn't even close. Better image quality, faster channel switching, and no random disconnections. Support helped me transition smoothly." },
  { name: "Julien D.", flag: "🇨🇦", rating: 5, title: "Support doesn't disappear after payment", text: "What I appreciate about Stream Bleu is that support doesn't disappear after payment.

  { name: "Mark L.", flag: "🇺🇸", rating: 5, title: "Most stable IPTV service I've had", text: "I've been using Stream Bleu for several months now, and it's the most stable IPTV service I've had. Live sports work perfectly, VOD loads fast, and support is responsive and polite whenever I need help. This is rare in the IPTV world." },
  { name: "Benjamin R.", flag: "🇨🇦", rating: 5, title: "Strong performance and real support", text: "I switched to Stream Bleu after comparing it with cheaper alternatives. Those services always had compromises. Stream Bleu delivers strong performance and real customer support. Activation was quick and assistance was available whenever needed." },
  { name: "Chris A.", flag: "🇺🇸", rating: 5, title: "Stream Bleu restored my trust in IPTV", text: "Stream Bleu restored my trust in IPTV services. After several bad experiences, I was ready to quit IPTV completely. Stream Bleu proved that a service can be stable, honest, and supported by real people who care about customers." },
  { name: "Patrick O.", flag: "🇺🇸", rating: 5, title: "Premium and reliable", text: "The service quality with Stream Bleu is clearly higher than other providers I've tried. Channels are stable, VOD selection is excellent, and support explains things properly instead of rushing. It feels premium and reliable." },
  { name: "Stefan M.", flag: "🇨🇦", rating: 5, title: "Delivers exactly what they advertise", text: "I appreciate how knowledgeable Stream Bleu's support team is. They explained differences between apps and devices instead of giving vague answers. My old provider oversold features that didn't work. Stream Bleu delivers what they advertise." },
  { name: "Jason F.", flag: "🇺🇸", rating: 5, title: "Reliable during peak times", text: "What sets Stream Bleu apart is reliability during peak times. My old provider always failed during big events.
